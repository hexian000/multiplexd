"""Run clang-tidy on production sources and write build/lint.md.

Usage:
  scripts/lint.py                            # all configured checks
  scripts/lint.py readability-function-size  # one check (exact name or glob)
  scripts/lint.py -o PATH                    # custom output file
  scripts/lint.py -j N                       # parallel jobs (default: nproc)
  scripts/lint.py --build DIR                # custom build directory
  scripts/lint.py --tests                    # also lint *_test.c files
  scripts/lint.py --generated                # also lint *.gen.c files
  scripts/lint.py --no-denoise               # keep known false positives
  scripts/lint.py --raw-list PATH            # also write a diffable raw findings list

The CHECK argument is forwarded verbatim as the glob in -checks='-*,CHECK'.
Use a trailing '*' for prefix matching, e.g. "readability-*".

Production code is defined as all C sources under src/ that are not test
files (*_test.c) and not generated files (*.gen.c). The third-party tree
(contrib/) is always excluded; --tests and --generated opt the respective
file groups back in.

Denoising: some valuable checks fire false positives on this project's own
facilities (the archetype is misc-include-cleaner on utils/ctype_ascii.h, an
ASCII-only <ctype.h> replacement). Findings that can be *proven* to be such
false positives are withheld from the main report into a separate section;
anything uncertain is kept, so a real defect is never dropped. --no-denoise
disables the pass entirely.

# Denoising
#
# Some checks are valuable in general but fire false positives when a header
# genuinely provides a symbol yet clang-tidy's include-cleaner fails to credit
# it. The archetype is misc-include-cleaner and utils/ctype_ascii.h, which
# defines the character-classification family (isdigit, isalnum, isprint,
# tolower, ...) as ASCII-only macros that deliberately replace <ctype.h> — the
# two are mutually exclusive, ctype_ascii.h #errors if ctype.h's macros are
# already defined.
# include-cleaner maps those names to <ctype.h> unconditionally and reports "no
# header providing isdigit", a demand that is impossible to satisfy here.
#
# strings/uctype.h repeats the pattern one layer up: it is the char32_t/UTF-8
# counterpart to ctype_ascii.h and, in the WITH_ICU build, claims the very same
# <ctype.h> names as macros over uctype_* functions. It carries the same
# mutual-exclusion #error, so a file including it cannot also include <ctype.h>
# — yet include-cleaner still demands <ctype.h> for every isdigit/tolower/...
#
# The same failure recurs for several standard/third-party headers whose symbol
# supply clang's map misattributes or overlooks: <sys/wait.h> (wait-status
# macros clang credits to <stdlib.h>), <errno.h>, <netinet/in.h> and <net/if.h>
# (whose symbols clang can miss), <syslog.h> (a one-line wrapper around glibc's
# <sys/syslog.h>, which is where the decls physically live and where clang
# points), the POSIX types ssize_t/socklen_t (a real provider header is
# included, yet clang reports none), and libraries that expose a prefixed symbol
# family through public headers that are not where the decls end up: libsodium
# (<sodium.h>) and Lua (<lua.h>) funnel theirs through one umbrella, while ICU
# rewrites every C symbol through <unicode/urename.h> (u_tolower ->
# u_tolower_77), so the visible decl never sits in the documented
# <unicode/*.h>. Each surfaces as one of two misc-include-cleaner phrasings: the
# symbol reads as unprovided ("no header providing ..."), or the header reads as
# unused ("included header ... is not used directly").
#
# The denoiser withholds only findings it can PROVE are such false positives;
# it must never drop a finding that could be a real defect. Every rule is a
# _Provider entry anchored to concrete evidence in the source: a finding is
# suppressed only when the file actually includes the provider header AND the
# flagged symbol genuinely belongs to that provider (an exact name, a name
# parsed out of one of our own replacement headers, or a library symbol-prefix).
# A missing include unrelated to a known provider (pid_t, char32_t, ...) is left
# untouched, as is a header whose symbols overlap other headers (e.g.
# <sys/types.h> reported unused — possibly a genuine redundant include — is
# never suppressed) and a name this project itself also defines (LOG_PERROR is
# both a <syslog.h> option and a utils/slog.h macro, so it is excluded from the
# <syslog.h> rule). Suppressed findings are still reported in their own section,
# and --no-denoise disables the pass, so nothing is silently hidden.
